# Stock-Prediction-Transfomers

The nature of our study is a time series problem, using stock market behavior to forecast the market closing price, for which we will be using the stock market information of Goldman Sachs. As we know Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) have become a common use for time series analysis, however there is some criticism to it. There are some papers published that say that it is in fact impossible to predict stock markets at all, because they are very random, and susceptible to too many uncontrollable factors. Other concern is that LSTM work better when looking at a short time window, a one-day prediction for example, but will struggle to predict based on years of data, like stock market behavior. While researching about the topic, we noticed that for time series prediction, people in the field are not only relying in LSTM alone but are also applying some new techniques. To try and prevent those LSTM memory problems we are applying some of those techniques: Time2Vec, Encoder-Decoder Model, Attention Mechanism (an upgrade to Encoder-Decoder Model).
